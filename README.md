## Process

- [DOING] Problem Description
- [ ] Requirements-Draft
- [ ] System-Environment Graph/Architecture (Flow Design)
- [ ] Graph of interactions (Flow Design)
- [ ] Broad Design (Flow Design)
- [ ] in-depth design where necessary (Flow Design)

## Background / Problem

We work with a [kanbanflow based](https://kanbanflow.com) board. The board has several columns that cover our process.
The board at the moment contains 177 tasks in 12 process steps.
During the week about 50 tasks will enter and exit the board again (as completed). 

The managers tasks are:
- Be informed about the tasks on the board.
- Make sure, that for every task it is clear what is to do next. (Prioritize)
- Make sure our developer(s) know that it is clear what they need to do next.
- Collect reports from our developer(s) about progress.
  - Make sure the tasks for the developer(s) are not too big, so that progress reports are regularily going out.
  - Keep a time plan / forecast for the currently running projects up-to-date.

That is a lot to keep in mind and we do not perform optimally. Still, this is necessary to deliver good results.

The problem will actually stay this way and only increase with task count.

## Current Situation

- The manager

- How did you identify the problem at the site of occurrence ([[Gemba]])? (Really go to the site and look at the challenge there to make sure you really understand the problem. Confirm the facts by "go and see")
- What numbers, data, and facts have you collected?
- How have you broken down the problem into sub-problems?
- How have you prioritized the sub-problems (degree of importance, urgency, potential spread)? Which of the sub-problems do you want to address within the scope of this A3 (possibly not all)?
- How have you located the site of occurrence?
- The place where the symptoms were discovered may not be where the problem occurred. Are you sure you have gone the whole way?
- How did you measure the initial situation?

## Target Situation

1. What is the ideal situation (True North)? 
2. Is the goal measurable?
3. Does the goal meet the SMART criteria (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound)?
4. What measure/result do you expect in the target situation?

## Immediate Measures

Table of What, Who, When, Status, Effectiveness (2 lines?)

## Root Cause Analysis

- Logic trees, probably Current Reality Tree or Future Reality Tree
- 5-Why method
- Fishbone diagram / Ishikawa diagram (Man, Method, Machine, Material, Environment -> Effect)
- Fault Tree Analysis (Suggested by Jens)
	  
## Problem Solution / Countermeasures / Action Plan

- Brainstorming: Establish and evaluate solution alternatives, as well as select
- Small PDCA cycles
- Could contain table: What, Who, When, Status, Effectiveness

## Success Measurement

- Starting from the initial state, what are the progress and possibly the final measurement.
- How much have we improved?

## Standardization and Knowledge Transfer

- How do we anchor the solutions in our daily work routines?
